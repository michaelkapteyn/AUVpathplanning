    "# 1.0 Introduction\n",
    "## 1.1 Motivation \n",
    "Science gain on exploration missions is often limited by factors related to the vehicle's endurance. In particular, energy consumption and battery capacity often limit the length of a mission. The demand for more extensive missions calls for an optimization that goes beyond the vehicle itself, by also leveraging the vehicle's environment to achieve maximum efficiency. However, while models about the environment often contain information about obstacles, uncertain/unknown regions, currents, etc. such models are often subject to uncertainty and may ultimately lead to hazards for the vehicle and/or its environment. Therefore, autonomous vehicles need to be able to account for their environment and the uncertainty that is associated with their models. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "Known for its underwater missions, the Model-Based Embedded and Robotics Systems (MERS) group at MIT is contacted by an ocean research institute (ORI), and is asked to provide robotic support for underwater data collection. More specifically, the ORI wants to conduct several missions in the vicinity of an underwater volcano, in order to learn about when the volcano will erupt next. Besides oceanography, the ORI also engages in research on an endangered sharks species that is quite common in the area around the volcano and wants to conduct a shark observation mission. As the ORI cannot send any humans to these areas and does not have any experience with robotics they need MERS' help.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MERS group already has an AUV that can perform the required sampling tasks. However, the ORI warns the group that the mission environment is very risky, and contains many obstacles that must be avoided. The ORI also warns that the mission region is prone to strong underwater currents. These currents are strongly dependent on the time of the day. In order to prevent having to fight currents the MERS group decides to conduct the first mission in the early morning, when there is no current. However, the shark observation mission can only be done in the early afternoon as this is the time when the sharks come up from the depths to have themselves cleaned by small cleaner fishes. The currents in the afternoon are known to be strong, steady, unidirectional currents. The ORI gives one final warning that, in the evening, these currents transition into dangerous circular, so-called _whirlpool_ currents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MERS group is very excited to be part of the institute's research and starts to think about how to go about planning the missions. Both risk and currents are challenges that the group has not faced before. The group knows that strong currents could greatly affect energy efficiency, so they decide to try and improve their existing path-planning algorithms, so that they can incorporate risk and underwater currents. Please see the two missions visualized below:\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Outline\n",
    "In this tutorial we will develop a set of path planning algorithms which take into account risk as well as ocean currents for energy-efficient path planning in uncertain environments. First, we will introduce two path-planning algorithms, demonstrate their behavior, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Second, we will introduce an autonomous underwater exploration mission and describe how we model the environment, the AUV, and the mission parameters. Then, the environmental model will be extended to incorporate risk (e.g. due to obstacles), as well as a model of ocean currents. Finally, we will discuss how to incorporate uncertainty in both the risk and current models using this framework. Along the way, we will demonstrate the path planning algorithms by applying them to a selection of mission scenarios with varying risks and ocean currents (see figures below). We will also analyze and compare the performance of each path planning algorithm with respect to the vehicle's energy savings.\n",

    "## 2.1 Introduction to the basic path-planning algorithms\n",
    "The two algorithms we will be utilizing are A\\* and Dijkstra's. A\\* is known as a \"best-first\" search algorithm. The idea is to use the heuristic cost, along with distance, in order to decide the order of the nodes in the priority queue. For each current node, we place the neighbors in a priority queue and compute their heuristic cost through the current node. We then extend the neighbor that has the least cost and repeat this process until the goal node is reached. More information can be found on [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dijkstra's algorithm is a shortest path finder. Similarly to A\\*, we look at the neighbors of the current node and compute the distances to each neighbor through the current node. If a computed distance is shorter than the shortest distance currently recorded in that neighbor, their shortest distance is updated. Then, the current node is set to the neighbor with the smallest distance. This continues until the goal node is reached. More information can be found on [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm).\n"

    "Note the difference in the exploration of the search space between A\\* and Dijkstra. The A* planner uses its heuristic to quickly extend its search only in the direction of the goal. Because only a few nodes are explored, fewer calculations are needed and the runtime is relatively short. Dijkstra's algorithm, in contrast, searches uniformly throughout the environment through multiple paths simultaneously until the goal is found. Since more nodes are explored, this algorithm has a longer runtime. However, with our current simple environment, both will ultimately find the same path."
